      "full": "The Mara is a female nightmare spirit from Slavic and Germanic folklore, representing the etymological origin of the English word 'nightmare' (literally 'night-Mara'). Described as a female entity that visits sleepers at night, the Mara sits on the victim's chest like riding a horse, causing bad dreams, sleep paralysis, and suffocating sensations. In Slavic traditions, the Mara has a dual nature—sometimes appearing as a demonic entity, other times as the involuntarily wandering soul of a living person (often a woman) who leaves her body at night. These individuals might be identified by disheveled hair and sweating after their nocturnal activities. Protection methods include iron objects, brooms by the door, shoes placed backwards, and Christian prayers. The Mara represents one of the most widespread cultural interpretations of sleep paralysis, with the word itself surviving in modern English long after the original supernatural meaning faded."
